 * 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
 * <p>
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I
 * picked. Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
 * You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
 * <p>
 * -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick). 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked
 * (i.e. num < pick). 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick). Return the number that I
 * picked.
