 * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of

  // Note, in this approach, I build an imaginary array of m * n and just perform a binary search.
  // I have to take care of index mapping.

  // However, this approach has a drawback. What if matrix rows were written on a hard drive, while only a single row could fix RAM.
  // Let's imagine, that all first elements of each row could be kept in RAM - similar to indeces.
  // In this case, the complexity of the algorithm would be the same: finding the row - O(log(m)) and finding the column - O(log(m)).
